# Sprudel
flexible webapp for scheduling and polls

# Description
Sprudel is a self-hosted WebApp based on PHP and MySql. It offers simple polls for scheduling events, but it's not limited to polling dates. You may also create polls to plan who's bringing what for the buffet or how you should name your firstborn or whatever.  
Sprudel is meant to be easy to use and offers all the relevant features you need for a (scheduling) poll - no more no less.  

# Features
- easy, clean polls for events (dates) or anything you want, really
- yes/no/maybe options
- unique URL for sharing and accessing a poll
- entries can be removed or overridden
- commenting feature
- easily customizable: all the labels can be set to custom strings, so you can change the language and all
- cleanup-script included for deleting polls that have been inactive for more than X days (can be run via cronjob)
- one-click copying of the poll URL
- optional admin link functionality to keep participants from editing/deleting the poll
- optional poll administration interface for managing all the polls on the server

# Requirements
- PHP 5.4 or higher  
- A MySql database  

# Installation
This is fairly easy *if* you know how to create a new MySql-database and how to upload files to your webserver. If you don't, try to find out how these things are done beforehand - it's easy to find tutorials on this on the internet!
- Create an empty MySql database on your server
- Download Sprudel as .zip-archive from this repository
- Extract the contents of the archive into a new directory (e.g. "sprudel")
- Copy the 'config.php_template' and rename the copy to 'config.php'
- Edit the config.php file and insert the database's credentials (read comments!)
- __If you want to use the optional admin interface__ (to view and delete any polls without owning the poll) you have to set this in the config.php, too! If you do so, please secure the 'admin'-directory, so it cannot be accessed without a password! If you run Sprudel on an Apache webserver, you CAN use the '\_template'-files in this directory and change them to you needs. Please read about how to secure a directory on your web server before using the admin interface!
- Upload the sprudel-directory to your server (root-directory or somewhere else)
- Access the admin/install.php through your browser (e.g. domain.com/sprudel/admin/install.php)
- If everything is fine, Sprudel will tell you so.
- Delete the admin/install.php from your server
- If you are using the admin interface, create .htaccess and .htpasswd file in admin/ to secure the access.
- Enjoy
